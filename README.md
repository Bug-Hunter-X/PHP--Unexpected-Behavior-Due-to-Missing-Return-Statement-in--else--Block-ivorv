This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in PHP: a function missing a return statement in an `else` block. The bug and its solution are provided in separate PHP files. The bug showcases a scenario where a function doesn't always return a value, leading to potential errors if the calling code doesn't handle the undefined return. The solution corrects this by ensuring a value is always returned, regardless of the condition.
